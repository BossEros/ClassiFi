Always apply the following principles when coding:
- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Build only what is needed for current requirements.
- **SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)**: Keep each function, class, and module focused on one clear responsibility.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Reuse existing logic and avoid duplicate implementations.
- Then apply the rest of SOLID and other relevant engineering principles.
