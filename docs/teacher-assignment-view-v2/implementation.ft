# Teacher Assignment View Implementation Flow Tracker

Project: ClassiFi  
Owner: TBD  
Start Date: 2026-02-24  
Current Phase: Phase 0

## 1. Purpose

This file tracks execution sequence, dependencies, gate checks, and decisions.  
Use this with `design.md` and `task.md` for day-to-day delivery.

## 2. Phase Plan

| Phase | Objective | Output | Done Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Baseline and alignment | Confirm routes, data sources, UX scope | Team signs off on scope and route plan |
| 1 | Overview data model | Computed status buckets and counts | Overview page can show correct totals and filters |
| 2 | Overview UI | Stats bar, filters, rows/cards | Teacher can find needs grading, late, missing quickly |
| 3 | Submission drill-down | New submission review route/page | Teacher can open one submission and grade from there |
| 4 | Hardening | Tests, edge cases, empty/error states | Tests pass and manual QA checklist is green |
| 5 | Release prep | Docs updates and rollout notes | Team can deploy with rollback guidance ready |

## 3. Workstream Breakdown

## 3.1 Frontend Workstream

1. Extend `AssignmentSubmissionsPage` state model.
2. Add roster-submission merge logic.
3. Implement filter tabs and stats strip.
4. Add `submissionId` drill-down route.
5. Build submission review page.

## 3.2 Backend Workstream (Optional for v1)

1. Keep existing endpoints first.
2. Evaluate need for merged overview endpoint.
3. Add endpoint only if frontend merge complexity becomes high.

## 4. Delivery Gates

## Gate A: Data Correctness

1. Missing count matches class roster minus submitted students.
2. Late count matches deadline rules.
3. Needs grading count matches `grade == null`.

## Gate B: UX Completeness

1. Filters produce expected list.
2. Search works with filters.
3. Drill-down opens correct submission.

## Gate C: Reliability

1. Required build/type/test commands pass.
2. Empty and error states are stable.
3. No regression in student assignment flow.

## 5. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Roster and submission mismatch | Wrong missing counts | Add explicit merge utility with tests |
| Route confusion between shared and teacher pages | Navigation bugs | Keep teacher route explicit and centralize route helpers |
| Mixed status logic duplication | Inconsistent UI | Create one status selector utility reused by page/components |
| Slow loading on large classes | Poor UX | Add pagination or virtualized list if needed |

## 6. Decision Log

Use this format for each design/implementation decision:

| Date | Decision | Reason | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-02-24 | Track in separate folder `docs/teacher-assignment-view-v2` | Preserve existing docs | No disruption to previous work |

## 7. Verification Checklist

Run before marking any phase complete:

1. Frontend: `npm run build` in `/frontend`
2. Backend: `npm run typecheck` in `/backend-ts`
3. Backend: `npm test` in `/backend-ts`

## 8. Progress Snapshot

| Date | Phase | Completed | Blockers | Next Step |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-02-24 | Phase 0 | Tracking docs created | None | Start baseline scope confirmation |
