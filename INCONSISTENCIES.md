# Codebase Inconsistencies Report

This document outlines the inconsistencies found within the ClassiFi codebase, including discrepancies between documentation, file structure, and project requirements.

## 1. Backend Implementation Mismatch
- **Documentation**: The root `README.md` states the backend is a Python application (FastAPI + SQLAlchemy) located in the `backend/` directory.
- **Codebase**: The actual backend is a Node.js application (Fastify + TypeScript) located in the `backend-ts/` directory.
- **Impact**: New developers following `README.md` will be misled. Links to `backend/README.md` are broken.

## 2. Package Manager Discrepancy
- **Requirements**: Project guidelines state that `pnpm` is the required package manager and `npm`/`yarn` are forbidden.
- **Codebase**:
  - `pnpm-lock.yaml` is missing in both `frontend/` and `backend-ts/`.
  - `package-lock.json` (generated by npm) is present in both directories.
  - `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` instruct the use of `npm` commands (e.g., `npm install`).
- **Impact**: Violation of the "pnpm only" rule and potential dependency resolution issues.

## 3. Frontend Architecture Violations
- **Requirements**: The frontend should follow a strict structure with `business`, `data`, and `presentation` directories at the root, and "no `src` directory allowed".
- **Codebase**: A `frontend/src/` directory exists and contains active components (e.g., `frontend/src/components/plagiarism/`).
- **Documentation**: `frontend/documentation.md` acknowledges `src` as "Feature-specific modules", contradicting the strict "no src" rule found in project guidelines.
- **Impact**: Architectural confusion and split component locations (`presentation/components` vs `src/components`).

## 4. Environment Configuration
- **Requirements**: Frontend requires `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in `frontend/.env`.
- **Codebase**: `frontend/.env` is missing from the file system.
- **Impact**: The frontend application will likely crash or fail to initialize the Supabase client at runtime.

## 5. Broken Documentation Links
- **Root README.md**:
  - Links to `./backend/README.md` (Broken, directory does not exist).
  - Links to `./frontend/CLAUDE.md` (Broken, file does not exist; likely `frontend/documentation.md`).
  - Links to `./CLAUDE.md` (Broken, file does not exist; likely `AGENTS.md`).

## 6. Frontend Linting Configuration
- **Issue**: The `frontend/eslint.config.js` file may be misconfigured regarding plugin definitions, causing `pnpm lint` to fail (as noted in project memory).
